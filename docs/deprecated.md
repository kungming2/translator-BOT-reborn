# Deprecated Features

[‚Üê Back to Home](./index.md)

## Introduction

This document outlines some of the routines and functions that were formerly part of the codebase but have been deprecated or sunsetted for various reasons.

## Former Routines

* **Zifang** - a parallel routine that handled Wikipedia lookups and duplicate detection. All of its functions have been integrated into Ziwen.
* **Ziwen Streamer** - a routine that streamed submissions from the entire site to cross-post posts with `!translate` or `!translator`. With the introduction of Reddit's native cross-posting ability, the need for this function was made obsolete.
* **Ziwen Hourly** - a routine that updated the sidebar on Old Reddit with information about the last twenty-four hours' statistics, posted the weekly 'Unknown' round-up, and also backed up its files. Its routines were moved into [Wenyuan](./wenyuan.md) and then [Wenju](./wenju.md) today. 

## Former Functions

* **!restore** - allowed translators to retrieve information about a post from [Pushshift](https://search-tool.pushshift.io/#_) if the OP had deleted it. Pushshift became a [mod-only tool without an API](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/14ei799/pushshift_live_again_and_how_moderators_can/) in June 2023 and this command became obsolete. 
* **!note** - allowed moderators to save a post and its information to a central wikipage. As the bot's capabilites expanded, the need for a central wikipage was obviated as there was much more information available in local databases.  
* **!reference** - gave users reference information about a language, somewhat like the `/lang` [command of Zhongsheng](./commands_discord.md). It was rarely used and sunsetted.  
* **!rotate** - [allowed users](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/au2b57/meta_image_rotation_available_via_rotate_courtesy/) to rotate an image a specified number of degrees, or flip it horizontally or vertically. Written by u/AdvancedAverage and running on the u/imagerotationbot account, it ceased to work in April 2019. Given its utility it can definitely be brought back if a suitable image hosting site can be found.
* **!delete** - part of Ziwen Streamer, it allowed OPs of a cross-post or the mods to delete a cross-post on r/translator. 
* **App posts** - "multiple" posts could have this special categorization if they were for a program or application. The community's rules have since been made stricter about for-profit requests, and this became almost never used. Sunsetting it also freed up the code `app` to represent the [correct language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apma_language).
* **r/translate corrector** - run under Ziwen Streamer, it corrected mentions of r/translate by directing people to r/translator. r/translate is now set up as a redirect to r/translator and this is no longer needed.

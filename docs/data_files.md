# Deprecated Features

[‚Üê Back to Home](./index.md)

## Introduction

This document outlines the folders in the primary `Data` folder, which contains all files needed for the bot to run. Files are generally in one of the following formats:

* [YAML](https://yaml.org/): Data files that may need regular human queries.
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html): Data files that generally do not need human queries.
* [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite): Large databases that need to respond to rapid queries. 
* [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values): Tabular data.
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): In this project, this format is generally used for consistency in any text file, even if it does not match the Markdown specification fully. 

## Root

| Filename | Function                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `auth.yaml` | Authentication information and API keys. | 
| `responses.yaml` | Response templates for the bot.          |

## Archival

Contains two files:

| Filename | Function                                                                    |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `all_identified.md` | Archives all historical post identification data.                           | 
| `all_saved.md` | Archives all saved post identification data (non-template supported posts). | 

## Databases

These are all [SQLite databases](https://sqlite.org/).

| Filename   | Function                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ajo.db`   | Ajo database for all requests.                        | 
| `cache.db` | Contains a cache for comments and points multipliers. | 
| `main.db`  | Main database for all other information.              | 

#### ajo.db Tables

* **ajo_database**: Contains all [ajo](./models.md) records. Note that pre-2.0 Ajos are saved as a Python string representation while post-2.0 ones are saved in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html); the bot contains compatibility for loading both types.

#### cache.db Tables

* **comment_cache**: Contains recently posted comments to check against to see if edits have been made to comments with new commands.
* **lookup_cjk_cache**: Contains cached data for recent [CJK lookup](./lookup.md) results.
* **multiplier_cache**: Contains multipliers for [points](./points.md).

#### ajo_database

* **acted_comments**: Contains a list of comments that have been acted on by non-Ziwen routines. 
* **internal_posts**: Contains internal (meta and community) posts data. Roughly speaking, a stripped-down version of `ajo_database`. 
* **notify_cumulative**: Contains dictionaries recording the total number of notifications a user has received, indexed by language code. 
* **notify_internal**: A list of usernames and internal post types that those usernames are subscribed to. (one post type / user per row)
* **notify_users**: A list of usernames and languages that those usernames are subscribed to. (one language_code / user per row)
* **old_comments**: Internal list recording comment IDs that have already been seen and processed by the bot. 
* **old_posts**: Internal list recording post IDs that have already been seen and processed by the bot. 
* **total_commands**: Contains dictionaries recording the total number of commands and actions a user has taken.
* **total_points**: Large table containing points data per comment, username, and post.
* **verification_database**: Contains verification requests, sorted by username and language.

## Logs

For logs, _running_ refers to a fixed-size buffer that retains the most recent data, which can span days or weeks. _Cumulative_ refers to logs that retain all data recorded since the feature was implemented.

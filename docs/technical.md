# Technical Information

[← Back to Home](./index.md)

* All routines are currently run on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Ziwen runs on a 5-minute [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) loop; that is, it checks for new posts, messages, and commands every 5 minutes.
  * In the past, routines have been run from a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* Ziwen's databases and required files are routinely backed up. 
* If Ziwen will be down for any reason, there will be a stickied announcement on r/translator.

## Naming Conventions

The bot routines are named after the courtesy names of prominent Han Dynasty people:

* [Wenju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong_Rong) (文舉)
* [Wenyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi) (文远)
* [Zhongsheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Chao) (仲升)
* [Ziwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Qian) (子文)
* [Zifang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Liang_(Western_Han\)) (子房)

Generally, statistics-related routines are named with an initial `w`, and command-related routines are named with an initial `z`.

Major classes in the routines are named after [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) [nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto#Grammar).

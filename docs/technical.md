### Technical Information

* Ziwen is currently run on a Raspberry Pi 4. It runs on a 5-minute cron loop; that is, it checks for new posts, messages, and commands every 5 minutes.
* Ziwen's databases and required files are routinely backed up. 
* If Ziwen will be down for any reason, there will be a stickied announcement on the bot's user page at u/translator-BOT.

* All routines are currently run on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Ziwen runs on a 5-minute [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) loop; that is, it checks for new posts, messages, and commands every 5 minutes.
  * In the past, routines have been run from a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* Ziwen's databases and required files are routinely backed up. 
* If Ziwen will be down for any reason, there will be a stickied announcement on r/translator.

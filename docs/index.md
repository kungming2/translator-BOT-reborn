# translator-BOT Documentation

### Introduction

This routine encompasses several routines that primarily serve **[r/translator](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/)**. 

* **Ziwén (子文)** is the component that handles real-time commands for r/translator. Under the username u/translator-BOT, it serves an essential role in community management by posting comments, sending messages, and moderating content. Additionally, it provides users with valuable reference information and notifications about requests for languages they might be interested in.
* **Wénjǔ (文舉)** is the component that handles general maintenance functions for the databases these routines use.
* **Zhòngshēng (仲升)** is the component that interfaces with Discord and responds to commands on our community oversight server. This component primarily surfaces functions of Ziwen for troubleshooting and casual queries.

# About

**Ziwén (子文)** is a Reddit bot that handles real-time commands for r/translator, the largest translation community on the website. 

It posts comments and sends messages under the username u/translator-BOT. Ziwen moderates and keeps r/translator organized, provides community members with useful reference information, and crossposts translation requests from elsewhere on Reddit.

This bot was rewritten in 2025 to improve code readability, functions, and potential extensibility, hence the "reborn" tag.

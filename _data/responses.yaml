  If you believe your request is *not* long, you (the OP) may comment `!long` to remove the status.

  * Proofreading of written English content: **r/Proofreading** (please note their sidebar rules for submissions.)
  * Decipherment of illegible handwriting: **r/transcription** 

  * If you're requesting the *review of a translation*, please include the source language name and its original text in your resubmitted post to r/translator.

# QUERIES FOR AI AGENTS

TITLE_PARSING_QUERY: >
  Assess this Reddit post title which is for a translation request. 
  Output what you assess to be the source language and target language, 
  and the percentage confidence for your assessment in valid JSON format:

  {{
    "source_language": {{
      "name": "LANGUAGE_1",
      "code": "LANGUAGE_1_ISO_639-3_CODE"
    }},
    "target_language": {{
      "name": "LANGUAGE_2",
      "code": "LANGUAGE_2_ISO_639-3_CODE"
    }},
    "confidence": PERCENTAGE (out of 1.0)
  }}

  If the title indicates that the user does not know the source language
   (e.g. the likely source is "I don't know"/"idk"/"no clue" return 
  the source_language name as "Unknown", and the source_language code as
  "unknown".

  CRITICAL: You MUST use ISO 639-1 codes (2 letters, e.g., "en", "es", "fr") 
  OR ISO 639-3 codes (3 letters, e.g., "eng", "spa", "fra") ONLY. 
  Do NOT use ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-5 codes under any circumstances.

  Use ISO 639-1 codes when available (preferred). Use ISO 639-3 codes ONLY 
  as a fallback for languages that do not have an ISO 639-1 code.

  Both source and target languages must have a valid ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-3 
  code to be included in the response, unless the source is "Unknown".

  If a source or target language cannot be assessed or does not have a valid
  ISO 639-1 or 639-3 code, return a blank dictionary ({{}}) for that language.

  This is the post title:

TITLE_REFORMATTING_QUERY: >
  Assess this malformed Reddit post title for a translation community.
  This title is for a post with source and target languages for 
  translation. If only a non-English language is mentioned in the title, 
  it can be assumed that the user wishes for the target language to be 
  English. If the language cannot be assessed, classify the source
  language as "Unknown" and the target language as "English."
  Format language names in title case.
  Based on the title, reformat and suggest a new title that strictly 
  follows the following format:
  
  Format: [Source_Language > Target_Language] (Other Title Content)
  
  Do not reply with anything other than the new, suggested title.
  
  This is the post title: 

IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_QUERY: >
  Provide a brief description of what is shown in this image, 
  suitable as alt text for accessibility. If text or written content is 
  visible, describe its appearance and context (e.g., 
  "handwritten note," "street sign in another language") 
  but do not transcribe or translate it. Keep the description to no more
  than three sentences.

# QUERIES FOR AI AGENTS

TITLE_PARSING_QUERY: "\nAssess this Reddit post title which is for a translation request. Output what\
  \ you assess to be the source language and target language, and the percentage confidence for your assessment\
  \ in this JSON format:\n\n{{\n  \"source_language\": {{\n    \"name\": \"LANGUAGE_1\",\n    \"code\"\

  \   \"code\": \"LANGUAGE_2_ISO_639-3_CODE\"\n  }},\n  \"confidence\": PERCENTAGE (out of 1.0)\n}}\n\n\
  Use ISO 639-1 codes for the languages if they are available. If a source or target language cannot be\
  \ assessed, return a blank dictionary ({{}}) for that language. Both source and target languages must\
  \ have an ISO 639 code to be valid.\n\nThis is the post title: \n"

TITLE_REFORMATTING_QUERY: >
  Assess this malformed Reddit post title for a translation community.
  This title is for a post with source and target languages for 
  translation. If only a non-English language is mentioned in the title, 
  it can be assumed that the user wishes for the target language to be 
  English. If the language cannot be assessed, classify the source
  language as "Unknown" and the target language as "English."
  Format language names in title case.
  Based on the title, reformat and suggest a new title that strictly 
  follows the following format:
  
  Format: [Source_Language > Target_Language] (Other Title Content)
  
  Do not reply with anything other than the new, suggested title.

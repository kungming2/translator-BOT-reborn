# QUERIES FOR AI AGENTS

TITLE_PARSING_QUERY: >
  Assess this Reddit post title which is for a translation request. 
  Output what you assess to be the source language and target language, 
  and the percentage confidence for your assessment in valid JSON format:

  {{
    "source_language": {{
      "name": "LANGUAGE_1",
      "code": "LANGUAGE_1_ISO_639-3_CODE"
    }},
    "target_language": {{
      "name": "LANGUAGE_2",
      "code": "LANGUAGE_2_ISO_639-3_CODE"
    }},
    "confidence": PERCENTAGE (out of 1.0)
  }}

  If the title indicates that the user does not know the source language
   (e.g. the likely source is "I don't know"/"idk"/"no clue" return 
  the source_language name as "Unknown", and the source_language code as
  "unknown".

  Use ISO 639-1 codes for the languages if they are available with ISO 639-3
  as a fallback if 639-1 codes do not exist for that language. If a 
  source or target language cannot be assessed, return a blank dictionary 
  ({{}}) for that language. Both source and target languages must have 
  an ISO 639 code to be valid, unless the source is "Unknown".

  This is the post title:

TITLE_REFORMATTING_QUERY: >
  Assess this malformed Reddit post title for a translation community.
  This title is for a post with source and target languages for 
  translation. If only a non-English language is mentioned in the title, 
  it can be assumed that the user wishes for the target language to be 
  English. If the language cannot be assessed, classify the source
  language as "Unknown" and the target language as "English."
  Format language names in title case.
  Based on the title, reformat and suggest a new title that strictly 
  follows the following format:
  
  Format: [Source_Language > Target_Language] (Other Title Content)
  
  Do not reply with anything other than the new, suggested title.
  
  This is the post title: 

IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_QUERY: >
  Provide a brief description of what is shown in this image, 
  suitable as alt text for accessibility. If text or written content is 
  visible, describe its appearance and context (e.g., 
  "handwritten note," "street sign in another language") 
  but do not transcribe or translate it. Keep the description to no more
  than three sentences.
